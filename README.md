我急着回家，我有点怀旧，我觉得太快了。在一个瞬间，盐川已经来找我。我的家已经在这里，我真的不想下车。
得闲的认知总有很多结论，不得闲的意境总有许多认知，嘴角就增长着光明的范围。
　　我就是在一次无意漫步路过那断崖的。山村的沉静与寂寞网一样罩住了我正在挣扎的灵魂和希望，而在我的身边，山是很高很高的，路是很长很长的，风是很凉很凉的，唯有诗歌，一直在我独守空旷的村庄的时候，把我引向从容和淡然，同时与古人作伴，浸身于前秦的智慧、盛唐的繁华，晚清的忧患。面对断崖，我总会想起历史，想起往事：那大地上的伤口，在风霜年复一年的吹打中，渐渐地长出的暗黑色的苔藓。在阳光的暴晒下，一粒粒小石子从石壁上绽裂开来，最后坠落在谷底，石子与断崖的诀离，却又找到了一条新的道路。虽然石子很小，新的梦想与渴望，却把小石子送上了新的旅途。于是，我每一次面对断崖，总会有不同以往的感想，但始终相同的是：断崖给我以一种不可遏止的沧桑感，断崖的背后永远是遥远的过去，断崖在空旷与落寞之中总是用自己的身影证明自己的存在：断崖总是在告诉我面对众多的苦难要不动声色。
Although everyone will die, selfish enough to comfort themselves, but really stationed at the entrances to the death, no one does not feel lonely fear.
This road seems to be busy, people first and subsequent, in this world, the same points in the same second, hundreds of thousands of people die at the same time, but each person's death is to do your own thing.
Your sorrow, your regret, your miss, your memories, their own, their own fears.
When all departing, the once lived life gradually sink into a piece of the black sea, which is light, big in relief.
While other people, no matter in what to do, but it is in the live, how unfair it is.
As soon as but thought flashed, too late to shout out loud, death is like a piece of the iron curtain, when under the hood...
It hasn't chronological dark down, the full round full moon was rising silence from the east.
In that first glorious is shallow, shallow gently give a fully flushed, is a girl shy blush, too many people must have a full moon tonight.
Now stars in the sky like a mutual common some in a quiet retreat, even if have a few naughty, blinked refused to go, and how disappointed, at a distance to the end of the world.
The sky is blue, the clouds of trickle-down to him;
The month is complete, follow that a blush faded, bright and clean in consolidating slowly, until the light is bright, is a part of the huge tracts of set in mid-air, immediately, going with the vast sky.
